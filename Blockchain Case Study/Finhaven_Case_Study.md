# Case Study Proposal: Finhaven

## What Is Finhaven
Finhaven is a financial services and technology company with a capital markets platform built on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and digital securities that removes friction from the buying, selling and handling of public and private securities — automating the exchange of documents and certificates that slows the current system down.

Finhaven Private Markets Canada (operated by Finhaven Capital Inc.) is a first-of-its-kind marketplace connecting issuers with accredited investors using safe, secure Distributed Ledger Technology (blockchain) and digital securities.

## Why This Matters

Finhaven Technology Inc. (“Finhaven) is a Vancouver-based financial services and technology company with a capital markets technology platform built on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and digital securities. Finhaven Private Markets (the market-facing name for Finhaven Capital Inc., a registered exempt market dealer in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec) is a marketplace built on the Finhaven Investment Platform to connect private issuers with accredited investors, providing private companies access to new capital and investors access to new opportunities.

This digital capital markets system allows for real time settlement that eliminates the need for external clearing agencies, central depositories, and custodians.

Finhaven’s technology is a simple, safe and secure paperless custodial and settlement solution for all market participants.

## Securities and Regulations
At Finhaven Private Markets, blockchain and digital securities are at the core of our technology and business. That puts us squarely in the conversation about NFTs (non-fungible tokens) — a trend capturing the imagination of investors and media alike.

Blockchain is revolutionizing the way contracts and agreements are created, and the way securities and assets trade hands between buyers and sellers. Digital securities or tokens rely on blockchain to verify their value and authenticity free from the need for paper-based contracts and share certificates.

NFTs are just that: tokens. If minted as a digital asset and offered for whole ownership, there’s no need to worry about securitization of the NFT. People are free to buy, sell and trade those tokens as they please.

But as soon as people look to create and market a NFT for real assets with investment contract elements and/or offer fractional ownership in a NFT, they have created a security. For example, if someone creates a NFT for a piece of art valued at $50 million and sells 50, $1 million shares, then one has created a security — and this requires the issuer to comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations.

And that’s where Finhaven Private Markets comes in. It is a registered exempt market dealer and marketplace with a platform that allows for buying and selling security tokens. It adheres to all regulations and compliance standards set by securities regulators from BC to Quebec in Canada. It is able to work with people looking to sell tokens, providing a simple turnkey solution in our digital marketplace.
